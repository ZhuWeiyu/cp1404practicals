1.Estimations for Practical Tasks

Throughout the course, I believe the weekly practical activities take roughly three or four days to accomplish, and the entire topic takes about 40 days. At first, it was difficult for me to precisely identify and understand the logic in the code, which hampered my overall efficiency. After class, I will watch educational videos to continue learning and improving my programming skills. Simultaneously, as the training progressed, I found it easier to understand the program's logic. These two enhancements allow me to solve assignments more effectively and demonstrate that I can proceed across the theme.

2.Code Reviews

Code review is a crucial step in the software development process that helps me gain a better knowledge of the accuracy and efficiency of computational code. It offers the chance to approach challenges in several ways. While doing this work, I can identify code issues and shorten the time it takes to correct them before implementation. I may gain knowledge from these distinctive viewpoints and apply some of their techniques to my own work to better understand challenges and discover new approaches to solving them.

3.Practical Tasks

In this task, I will make some alterations to the actual task. For example, learn from and learn from other people's more effective ways, increase the number of combination programs, and present more exciting and interesting projects to promote student engagement and understanding.
