#  CP1404 Practical

## Introduction
All of my weekly assignments for the course 1404, as well as all of my other assignments, are housed in this repository.

## Clean code
I learnt the following about clean code:
- Keep the space, naming, and indentation consistent. Enhance readability and comprehension of the code.
- Meaningful names: names are ubiquitous in software. So when naming variables, functions, parameters, classes, files and directories, you can communicate the purpose and function more effectively. Use names that reveal intent, avoid misinformation, pronounce, searchable, and meaningful in your code.
- Follow the code pattern: make the code easier to understand. Therefore, character changes in naming, such as the use of uppercase or lowercase, should be standardized.
