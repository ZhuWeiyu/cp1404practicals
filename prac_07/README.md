## Introduction
This repository contains practical exercises and projects completed as part of the CP1404 course. The practicals cover a range of programming topics and concepts, with a focus on clean code and effective software development practices.

## Clean code
Throughout this course, I have learned several important lessons about writing clean code:

Naming: Choose meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes to make the code more understandable and maintainable.
Comments and Documentation: Provide clear and concise comments to explain the purpose and behavior of code, as well as using docstrings for functions and classes.
Code Structure: Use appropriate whitespace, indentation, and line breaks to make the code more readable, and follow established language conventions and style guides.
